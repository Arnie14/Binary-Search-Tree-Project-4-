# Binary-Search-Tree-Project-4-
Binary Search Tree

Implement the BinarySearchTree class. The BinarySearchTree class extends
the BinaryTree class. Both can be seen here (Links to an external site.). Your assignment is to
implement all of the abstract methods of the BinaryTree class recursively. They are:

insert
iterator (non-recursive)
remove
search
You must also implement an Iterator inner class for the
BinarySearchTree class. You must submit a modified BinarySearchTree.java
file with your source code. Do not submit and do not modify
the BinaryTree.java file.
